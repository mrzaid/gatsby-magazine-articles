##Born in San Diego to a biker and a nurse, Durgin-Barnes moved to a suburb of Seattle with his mother when he was young and began drawing and painting at an early age, too early to remember. In Seattle, Durgin-Barnes continued drawing and eventually discovered skateboarding and grati, which led him to Jesse Edwards. Edwards introduced Durgin-Barnes to oil painting, sparking his career as an artist. Over the following decade Durgin-Barnes moved around a lot; San Francisco, Oakland, Reno, Portland and, eventually, Brooklyn, where he now resides in an apartment-studio (studio-apartment?) in Williamsburg with his girlfriend, his cat and his pet iguana.

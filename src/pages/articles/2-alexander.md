It’s usually hard to say exactly what it is you like about a painting. Does it have to do with the colors used, or the texture of the brush strokes? Do you appreciate the work for the artist’s precision of details, or for the magnitude and breadth of the arrangement of the piece? Is there a good feeling you get when you look at the painting? A bad one that you like anyway? These questions barely scratch the surface when it comes to aesthetic virtue and subjectivity. And yet they can be so difficult to answer. The trouble is we often don’t know we enjoy an artistic quality until it reaches out from the wall and slaps us.

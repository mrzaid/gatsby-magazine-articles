Music is a changing landscape. In some ways, the changes can be democratizing. In other ways, the music industry is more controlled than ever. Rising marketing and distribution costs can make album releases feel like political campaigns, namely the costs involved. Where Spotify and Soundcloud were envisioned to make discovering new music infinitely easier, there is still an unquenchable void for curated, fresh music. Hearing a beautiful song for the first time is a huge thrill. For me personally, I can’t run on nostalgic sounds forever. Music is an important part of the forward-facing narrative of life and humanity — I, and I hope we, want to feel we are moving forward while soundtracked by energetic new songs. Thankfully, living in New York almost guarantees finding problem-solvers and brave creatives if you look hard enough (or read 10011). Abu Recordings is on this front.
